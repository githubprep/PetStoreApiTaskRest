## Getting Started

It is a test automation framework for "Take Home Task: QA Engineer". You may clone project from given above gitHUB account.
Than you can run the framework in your local.  
Cucumber BDD Gherkin language is used. The base Url is in the configuration properties file under project. With configuration reader 
class we reach to the configuration properties. Pojo class is used for Json-Java convert.







### Prerequisites
It is Java-Rest project. To run it needs Java 1.8 jdk.
You may run that test framework on your local in your IDE (IntelliJ recommended). Also it can start from command line.
In order to run from commandline you need to have Maven in your local.

## Notes

The Petstore swagger document is updating  slowly sometimes. Even with manual testing with both swagger document and 
Postman I can not able to verify last changes with GET request. In test framework I don't want to add wait times since
it slows down the tests and the problem is from document. Sometimes (in general) GET tests failing. Than you may run again.
